# File descriptions

- `FLOAT2.BIN`: Binary input file that stores two 4-byte values representing two floats.
- `create_input.py`: Program that writes two floats to `FLOAT2.BIN`.
- `macros.asm`: Utility MARS macros (e.g., open/read files, swap register values, etc.).
- `Mn_018.asm`: Main program that computes the sum of two floats (stored in `FLOAT2.BIN`) without using MIPS floating-point instructions.
